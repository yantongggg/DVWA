# Command Injection Exploitation â€“ DVWA

## Overview
This section focuses on exploiting command injection vulnerabilities in DVWA at high security level.

The target was to execute arbitrary system commands via insecure input handling.

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite (to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests)
- Linux CLI (to validate command execution)

## Techniques Applied
- Bypassing insecure blacklist filters (`|cat /etc/passwd`)
- File disclosure from the server
- Verifying execution privilege (www-data)

## Key Payloads
- `127.0.0.1|cat /etc/passwd`
- `127.0.0.1|whoami`

## Screenshots
Exploitation steps and responses are documented in the `/screenshots` folder.
