# VAPT DVWA Exploitation Project

This project showcases the practical exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) platform.  
It is structured based on different vulnerability types tested at various DVWA security levels (Low, Medium, High).

## 📚 Contents

- [SQL Injection Exploitation](./SQL-Injection/sql_injection.md)
- [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation](./Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS/xss.md)
- [Command Injection Exploitation](./Command-Injection/command_injection.md)

Each section contains:
- Vulnerability Overview
- Weaknesses identified
- Step-by-step Exploitation Process
- Payloads and Testing Commands
- Recommendations (where applicable)
