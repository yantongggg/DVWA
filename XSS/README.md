# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation â€“ DVWA

## Overview
This section documents the exploitation of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in DVWA at high security level.

## Tools Used
- Burp Suite (for payload injection and interception)
- Custom payloads crafted manually

## Techniques Applied
- Reflected XSS via form input
- Cookie theft using document.cookie
